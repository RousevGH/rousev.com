In the city of Bling where the Bad Boys grew,
Lived a fellow named Diddy, who might, or not, diddle a few.
The tabloids would chatter, the lawyers would stew,
"Did Diddy diddle one? Did Diddy diddle two?"

A whisper, a rumor, a headline or two,
A tweet in the night with a questionable clue.
The bloggers went wild with espresso and glue,
"Could he diddle me? Would he diddle you?"

He strutted through mansions with mirrors and mist,
Each one reflecting a scandalist twist.
“Not guilty!” he’d cry with a diamond-clad fist,
While interns and dancers checked off a list.

The DJs, reporters, and fans in the stands,
All watching his yacht doing laps near the sands.
The beat dropped, the bass thumped, the lawsuits were grand,
And Diddy just nodded - “It’s all in the brand.”

But deep in the club when the smoke hit the hue,
Someone whispered again, “Was it one? Was it two?”
A producer, a model, a stylist named Lou,
No one could confirm it - not even the crew.

The judge wore his robe, the crowd wore their doubt,
The lights dimmed to silence, the truth didn’t shout.
For Seuss never planned for a world so askew,
Where rhymes meet reality and justice is due.

So here ends the tale, half riddle, half feud,
Of the mogul, the myth, and the media mood.
For whether he did or he didn’t intrude:
The moral’s quite simple: Don’t be a Diddly dude.
